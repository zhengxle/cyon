Cyon is a fast multithreaded key/value store.

Cyon uses persistence in the form of a log file which it writes operations
to before performing them on its in memory data structure.

Has two fsync options: fsync every 1 second, fsync every write.
The default is to fsync the log file every 1 second.

When Cyon writes its full data store to disk it is completely non blocking
and it recycles the log file after the data store is verified.

Cyon can also run as read-only slaves, or as non-persistent database where
it will not commit anything to disk. Slaves should be started with the -x flag.

See the scripts/cyon-sync.sh for an example of how a sync can be performed.

Cyon stores its data/index using a form of lookup-table, with all operations
being bound to the length of the key. However Cyon guarantees that for each
key of the same length the operations are O(1).

A quick and dirty cmd tool (cyon-cmd) is provided which can be used to
talk to a cyon server:
	# cyon-cmd -s 127.0.0.1:3331 stats

It is however very basic and a bad representation of how a client
should be done. It's only there for debugging purposes.

A client library for C exists, but is not part of this tree yet.

Under heavy development, but works fine.
