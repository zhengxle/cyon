Cyon is a fast multithreaded key/value store.

You can chose to store data + index in memory or only store the index in memory.
Has several data persistence options (fsync every 1 second, fsync every write).

The default is data + index in memory with fsyncs every 1 second.

Additionally, when data is stored in memory Cyon will write the operation
to a log file before performing the operation on its in memory data structure.

When Cyon writes its full data store to disk it is completely non blocking
and it recycles the log file after the data store is verified.

Cyon can also run as read-only slaves, or as non-persistent database where
it will not commit anything to disk.

Under heavy development, but works fine.
